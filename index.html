                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m interested in making computing education more accessible and personally meaningful through
                    Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI. My interest in computing began in seventh grade when I
                    started programming on my TI-84 calculator. At Temple University, I began researching
                    how to help novice students understand programming concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work currently explores how large language models (LLMs) can generate analogies, explanations,
                    and learning
                    materials that reflect students' interests and backgrounds. I am passionate about making computing
                    more inclusive,
                    especially for students who don’t yet see themselves represented in technical spaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the fall of 2025, I began my PhD at the <span class="blue">

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>
                    My research focuses on using LLMs to personalize learning in computing education. I study how
                    AI-generated
                    explanations and analogies can be adapted to align with students’ interests, cultural backgrounds,
                    and learning
                    needs.
                <p>
                    I combine LLMs with perspectives from HCI to better understand how to support intrinsic motivation
                    and deliver adaptive feedback.
                    This includes building interactive tools, analyzing student responses, and evaluating how
                    personalized
                    support affects comprehension. I’m focused on making sure these systems help students learn, not
                    replace or
                    mislead them.

            <!-- <h2>Service</h2>
                <p>
                    Most of my service work has been rooted in the Temple HCI Lab, where I took on a leadership role
                    mentoring newer students, facilitating reading groups, and organizing collaborative workshops. I
                    helped structure onboarding processes, provided feedback on projects, and worked closely with
                    faculty to ensure that students felt supported and engaged. An important aspect was creating an
                    environment where everyone
                    could contribute meaningfully—regardless of prior experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside the lab, I served as President of Temple’s ACM chapter. I worked with a small team to host
                    employer visits, technical workshops, student socials, and
                    events designed to bring the department together. I wanted ACM to feel like a space where students
                    could grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also directed OwlHacks, Temple’s annual hackathon, reviving the event after a two-year hiatus. We
                    organized two hackathons in under a year, growing participation by over 100 students and ending with
                    the largest hackathon in Temple’s history, with more than 250 attendees. I focused on building a
                    beginner-friendly experience that encouraged collaboration and learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve also mentored undergraduate researchers through the NSF REU program. My focus there was on
                    building a near-peer mentorship model where students felt comfortable asking questions and learning
                    research practices. I aimed to reduce the power distance between faculty and students by fostering a
                    supportive and conversational research environment.
